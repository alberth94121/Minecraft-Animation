The animated scene is a recreation of a scene
from a popular game known as Minecraft. The player
is mining diamond blocks and is trapped by three
circling green monsters known as creepers. After
a short period the creepers explode and destroy the
diamond blocks allowing the player to use them to create
a house in order to escape safely from the remaining
black monster known as the slenderman.

The hierarchial structure in this animation is the
slenderman with its two-level arms and legs.
The pickaxe head is the polygonal object created from
triangles to form a five-faced quadrilateral pyramid
The texture mapped objects are the creepers, the diamond
blocks, and the explosions created by the creepers.
The camera is directed using LookAt and a helper function
and framerate is displayed on the console window. Overall
the animated scene does not use very complex objects but 
was able to imitate the desired Minecraft scene quite well
